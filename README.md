Docker and Docker Compose Repository
This repository contains configurations for managing multiple Docker containers using Docker Compose. The setup includes:

A main docker-compose.yml file.

Individual YAML files for each container that extend the main Compose file.

Usage
Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can install it from Docker's official site.

Docker Compose: Verify Docker Compose is installed. You can check the version by running:

bash
docker-compose --version
Running the Project
Step 1: Pull Images and Start All Services
To start all containers with the main and extended configurations:

bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.container1.yml up -d
Use the -f flag to specify additional YAML files for other containers as needed.

Step 2: Check Running Containers
Confirm that all containers are running:

bash
docker ps
Step 3: Stop All Containers
To stop all running containers without removing them:

bash
docker-compose down
